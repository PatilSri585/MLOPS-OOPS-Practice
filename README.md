# MLOPS-OOPS-Practice

A Python practice repository demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through simple, educational examples.

## Description

This repository explores OOP principles in Python with practical implementations. It includes a basic social media console app and fundamental OOP examples to help beginners understand classes, objects, methods, and attributes.

## Features

- **Indiagram App** (`indiagram.py`): A simple console-based social media application with user authentication, posting, and messaging features.
- **Employee Class** (`oops.py`): Basic OOP example showcasing class initialization and methods.
- **Python Objects** (`why_python_is_oops.py`): Demonstrates that everything in Python is an object, highlighting the language's OOP nature.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PatilSri585/MLOPS-OOPS-Practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MLOPS-OOPS-Practice
   ```
3. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Usage

Run each script individually to explore the examples:

- **Indiagram App**:
  ```bash
  python indiagram.py
  ```
  Follow the menu prompts to sign up, sign in, post, or send messages.

- **Employee Class**:
  ```bash
  python oops.py
  ```
  Creates an employee object and demonstrates method calls.

- **Python Objects**:
  ```bash
  python why_python_is_oops.py
  ```
  Shows type information for various Python objects.
